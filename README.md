This system can determine a news is either fake or real more precisely and also it provide the accuracy of the news when user provide any article URL of any newspaper or news portal to the system as an input. Here the newspaper or news portal are those, which are published their news either in English or in Bangla language. Natural Language Processing (NLP), Deep Learning (DL) and Web-scraping techniques used in the back-end part of this web-application to identify a news is fake or real with its accuracy in percentage.

There are lots of works on Deep Natural Language Processing (Deep NLP) in English and these approaches are being used in many automated systems.Natural Language Processing on Bangla is very rare. But so far no process has been developed to predict fake news from English and Bangla languages news combinedly. This made myself to be interested to work with this research based project.
